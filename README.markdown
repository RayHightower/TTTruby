Experiment with TTT in Ruby.

## Setup

1. Install Ruby v2.3.2.
2. Run `$ gem install bundler` to let the dependency manager do what it
   does.
2. Run `$ bundle install` to install dependencies like `rspec`, `rspec-core`, `guard`, and `guard-rspec`. Note that `guard` and `guard-rspec` are optional, but they make the red/green/refactor experience most pleasurable!
3. Run `$ rspec` at the root of the project to run all of the tests.
4. Run `$ bundle exec guard` at the root of the project to make the tests run automatically every time a file is changed.
